## Updating Ruby on macOS

### WARNING: You are running Ruby 2.3.7, which is nearing end-of-life.

The Google Cloud API clients work best on supported versions of Ruby. Consider upgrading to Ruby 2.4 or later.
See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for more info on the Ruby maintenance schedule.
To suppress this message, set the GOOGLE_CLOUD_SUPPRESS_RUBY_WARNINGS environment variable.

Proceed with:

* https://medium.com/@IanRahman/how-to-upgrade-ruby-on-a-mac-a592c6085c63
* https://github.com/rvm/rvm/issues/4215
* https://rvm.io/rvm/security

### Could not find CFPropertyList-3.0.0 in any of the sources

Your bundle is locked to json (1.8.3.1), but that version could not be found in
any of the sources listed in your Gemfile. If you haven't changed sources, that
means the author of json (1.8.3.1) has removed it. You'll need to update your
bundle to a version other than json (1.8.3.1) that hasn't been removed in order
to install.

Proceed with:
```
$ bundle update
```

$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
